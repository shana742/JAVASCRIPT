2. WHAT IS PROMISE

->    a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its   resulting value. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations more easily and with cleaner syntax compared to traditional callback-based approaches.


-> A promise in three :
               A.Pending
               B.fulfiled
               c.Rejected
